## Right now

**P1 V1 Foundation landed on main (2026-04-22).** V1 Prompt Lab is now the daily-driver iteration surface. Lab renders route through AtlasCloud with `kling-v2-6-pro` default. Every iteration captures its SKU via migration 031 (`model_used` + `sku_source`). Migration 032 widens `cost_events.provider` to include `atlas`/`google`/`higgsfield` so Lab cost tracking lands cleanly. IterationCard has per-iteration SKU selector + cost chip + "Try another SKU" shortcut. TopNav renamed "Prompt Lab (legacy)" → "Prompt Lab"; Listings Lab (V2 paired-image) hidden from nav but direct URLs preserved. Canonical V1 vs V2 reference at [`state/MODEL-VERSIONS.md`](./state/MODEL-VERSIONS.md). Program spec for the next 2 weeks (P2–P7) at [`specs/2026-04-22-v1-primary-tool-and-ml-roadmap-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-22-v1-primary-tool-and-ml-roadmap-design.md) — supersedes the M.1-era back-on-track plan for all V1/ML work.

**Pre-cooked design artifacts on parked branches (ready for integration at phase-scheduled sessions):**
- `session/p2-rubric-design` — P2 Gemini auto-judge rubric (JUDGE-RUBRIC-V1.md, 7 Qs resolved). Integrates at P2 S1 2026-04-23.
- `session/p3-embedding-preflight` — P3 image-embedding provider decision (Gemini 768-dim, 5 Qs resolved). Integrates at P3 S1 2026-04-25.
- `session/p5-thompson-design` — P5 Thompson router design (528-line spec, 6 Qs resolved). Integrates at P5 S1 2026-04-30.

**Migrations 031 + 032 committed but NOT yet applied to the Supabase DB.** Apply before next V1 render (Task 12 smoke-render prerequisite). Once applied, first V1 render should populate `prompt_lab_iterations.model_used` + emit a `cost_events` row with `metadata.sku`.

**Not pushed:** all 2026-04-22 commits are local on `main`. Push pending explicit approval.

## Plan state

Phases of the back-on-track plan (full spec at [`specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md)):

| Phase | Status | What |
|---|---|---|
| A — Lab UX spine | shipped | `NextActionBanner`, priority chips, optimistic updates |
| M.1 — Director-prompt trace audit | shipped | Learning loop verified working-with-gaps; full audit at [`audits/ML-AUDIT-2026-04-20.md`](./audits/ML-AUDIT-2026-04-20.md) |
| DQ — Director concise prompts | shipped | `DIRECTOR_SYSTEM` enforces ≤120/≤250 char prompts, stability prefix `kling-v3-*`-only, paired auto-route to `kling-v2-1-pair`, default model flipped to `kling-v2-6-pro` |
| DM — Dev/Legacy merge | shipped | One unified Lab UI, native Kling provider added (Oliver's pre-paid credits), Compare demoted, legacy Lab routes retired |
| CI — Cost integrity | shipped (CI.1–CI.5) | Model-aware Claude pricing, OpenAI embedding tracking, Shotstack per-minute, failed-render policy, dashboard drill-down |
| C — Production end-to-end | shipped | Router `ProviderDecision`, base64 → URL, duration-aware director, lazy failover Kling → Atlas |
| M.2 — ML consolidation | ✅ shipped | SKU capture, dead code removal, prod embedding backfill |
| B — Model head-to-head | superseded by 2026-04-22 V1 program | Phase B static-router approach replaced by P5 Thompson sampling (docs/specs/p5-thompson-router-design.md). Existing Window D Round 1/2 work parked on `session/router-2026-04-21`; v3-strip intent migrated into `V1_ATLAS_SKUS` allow-list. No fresh manual rating grid required — P5 bootstraps from organic V1 ratings |
| **P1 — V1 Foundation** | ✅ shipped (2026-04-22) | V1 Lab becomes daily driver: Atlas routing (kling-v2-6-pro default), SKU capture (migration 031), cost_events widened (migration 032), SKU selector + cost chip + try-another-SKU UI, TopNav rename, V1 trace mode, deferred UX plan |
| P2 — Gemini auto-judge | pre-cooked design (branch `session/p2-rubric-design`) | Rubric + 10-shot calibration pool ready. Implementation scheduled 2026-04-23 S1 + 2026-04-24 S2 |
| P3 — Retrieval upgrade | pre-cooked provider decision (branch `session/p3-embedding-preflight`) | Gemini gemini-embedding-2 768-dim. Implementation scheduled 2026-04-25–27 (3 sessions) |
| P4 — Scale hardening | per spec | Scheduled 2026-04-28–29 (2 sessions) |
| P5 — Thompson router | pre-cooked design (branch `session/p5-thompson-design`) | Bandit math + cold-start + rollout gate final. Implementation scheduled 2026-04-30–05-01 |
| P6 — Active learning + pairwise | per spec | Scheduled 2026-05-02 |
| P7 — Promote-to-prod flywheel | per spec | Ongoing runbook; activates ~2026-05-05 |

## Known gotchas

- **File-revert mystery in this repo** — during one session in 2026-04-13, file edits got silently reverted by an unknown process. Dormant since but watch for it. Commit often; keep a memory backup of in-flight work.
- **Production `properties.selected_duration` column does not exist yet.** Phase C pipeline reads optimistically with `maybeSingle()` and logs a warn + defaults to 60s until the order-form persistence work lands.
- **Atlas pricing** for `v2.6-pro` was initially miscalibrated at 2× under. Now `$0.60/clip` confirmed. Other SKUs may still need invoice verification — see [`specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md) Phase CI notes.
- **Kling v3 shake issue** on single-image shots. Stability prefix (`CAMERA_STABILITY_PREFIX`) is applied only for `kling-v3-*` models after DQ; Atlas negative prompt is always applied.
- **Lab → prod promotion has never been used** — 0 overrides ever promoted per Phase M.1 audit. Signal is there but no one is turning recipes into active router directives. M.2 and B close this.
- **Prod scene embeddings** — all 24/24 scenes embedded after M.2 backfill (2026-04-21). Backfill script widened to all prod scenes (not just rated ones).

## Oliver's standing preferences

- Plain language, bottom-line, no jargon.
- **No git push / no Vercel deploy without explicit in-turn permission for destructive operations.** Blanket "direct-to-main" granted for routine current work — still ask on anything destructive (force push, rebase pushed history, column drops, file deletion outside the `archive/` pattern).
- Higher models (Opus) for design/audit tasks; Sonnet for implementation; Haiku only for trivial mechanical work.
- Cost tracking is first-class — every API call logs a `cost_event`, even $0 ones. Don't ship with null/0 cost fields on finalized renders.
- Efficient execution. Minimal questions. Pick the best path and proceed.

## Cross-repo state

Three working copies exist on disk, all pointing at the same GitHub repo (`theolivercollins/reelready`) on different branches:

| Path | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline` | `main` | **active** — all work lands here |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-finances` | `finances-tab` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `66135be` (finances-tab work, mid-April). Useful only as reference. |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-ui` | `ui-redesign` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `e54b2f2`. Older than main. |

Snapshots of the stale forks' `docs/` live under [`archive/forks/`](./archive/forks/) for historical record.

## Next session checklist

When you pick this up:
1. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) → this file → [`state/PROJECT-STATE.md`](./state/PROJECT-STATE.md) → [`plans/back-on-track-plan.md`](./plans/back-on-track-plan.md).
2. Confirm with Oliver whether Phase M.2 is re-dispatched or skipped before starting implementation.
3. Any push to `main` → append a line to "Recent shipping log" above AND update "Right now" if the next action changed.
4. Use the `superpowers` plugin for planning + execution. Don't freelance.
