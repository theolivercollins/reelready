## Right now

**2026-04-28: Ledger-driven system update + lab cost-tracking bug fix shipped to main (commit `cd242fc`).** Triggered after Oliver flagged "prompts aren't improving from my ratings". Investigation (full trail in [`sessions/2026-04-28-lab-cost-tracking-fix.md`](./sessions/2026-04-28-lab-cost-tracking-fix.md)) confirmed the rating loop *is* working post-fix `140c8f4`, but the latent ledger had never been crystallized into hard rules and a bigger bug was masking all lab cost telemetry.

- **Pending proposal `c0708a98-…`** — mined 196 rated iterations across 23 buckets into 6 concrete `DIRECTOR_SYSTEM` patches. Review at `/dashboard/development/proposals` and promote what looks right; promoted patches mutate the production director on the next render via `resolveProductionPrompt`.
- **Recipe pool 84 → 115** — backfilled 27 winners (4★+) that pre-dated the auto-promote logic. Pure DB op via `scripts/oneoff/backfill-recipes.ts`.
- **Thompson router 0 → 41 arms** — `router_bucket_stats` was empty, so SKU choice was always falling through to default. `npx tsx scripts/refresh-router-bucket-stats.ts --write` populated α/β posteriors from the rated ledger; router now starts steering SKU choice toward proven cells.
- **Cost-tracking bug fixed** (migration 045 + commit `cd242fc`). `cost_events.property_id` was `NOT NULL` with FK to `properties.id`, but every Lab cost-event insert (mine, embedding, recipe promote, listing director, listing chat, lab generation) sent `property_id: null` inside a `try/catch`. Two-layer mask: Supabase JS returns `{error}` rather than throwing (catch never fired) + the unused `console.error` had no audience. Audit before fix: 378 lab iterations created in 30d, only 17 lab-stage `cost_events` rows. Dropped the NOT NULL constraint + replaced every try/catch with explicit `{error: costErr}` checks at 10 insert sites. Today's $0.31 rule-mining cost backfilled. Going forward, every lab API call writes a cost row.
- **P2 Gemini auto-judge** is fully wired on main and dormant by design. Two-gate kill-switch: `JUDGE_ENABLED !== "true"` env var (poll-judge.ts:23) + `system_flags.judge_cron_paused = true` (DB row, paused 2026-04-24 by operator). Stays off until Oliver finishes manual rating runway.
- **One-off scripts** (kept under `scripts/oneoff/`): `run-mine-now.ts` (replicates `mine.ts` handler with service-role + streaming + 32k max_tokens — 8k cap truncated the response on 196 ratings × 23 buckets) and `backfill-recipes.ts` (reusable for future winner backfills).

---

**2026-04-24 (later): Iteration order-id system shipped (migration 041).** Every Lab iteration — past and future — now has a human-readable order number of the form `V{n}-{seq:05}`.

- **Scheme (durable convention):** V1 = `prompt_lab_iterations` (268 rows backfilled V1-00001..V1-00268), V2 = `prompt_lab_listing_scene_iterations` (98 rows backfilled V2-00001..V2-00098). V3+ reserved for future lab surfaces; add a new sequence + trigger when a new table is introduced.
- **Enforcement:** `order_id text NOT NULL UNIQUE` on each table; `BEFORE INSERT` trigger pulls the next value from `v{n}_iteration_seq` so application code cannot forget. Insert test confirmed: omitting `order_id` from an insert auto-assigns `V1-00269`.
- **Surfaced in UI:** Rating Ledger card shows the order_id under the SKU chip; PromptLab iteration card shows it next to "Iteration N". Ledger API adds `order_id` field to `LedgerRow` (null on prod surface — prod scene_ratings do not use the scheme).

**2026-04-24: Rating Ledger "atlas" SKU-leak fix merged to main (commit `4d868bd`).** `fetchLegacyLab` in `api/admin/rating-ledger.ts` was surfacing the Atlas provider name in the SKU slot whenever model_used was populated — the SELECT never pulled the column. Fix: new shared `lib/ledger/formatSku.ts` formatter (single source of truth for how ledger rows derive SKU), routed through every surface; local `providerToSku` deleted. Migration 040 applied to prod adds `CHECK (clip_url IS NULL OR model_used IS NOT NULL OR sku_source = 'unknown')` on `prompt_lab_iterations` — any future write path that marks a render complete without a SKU is rejected with `check_violation` at the DB layer. 146 pre-P1 rows grandfathered via `sku_source='unknown'`. Verified with synthetic negative-test insert + legacy-row UPDATE + full test suite (141 + 8 new = 149 green).

**2026-04-23 session shipped P2 Session 2 + P3 Session 1 retrieval-fusion completion.** Judge chip + Override panel live in IterationCard. Rating Ledger now shows human vs judge side-by-side with agreement color coding. Retrieval RPCs fuse text + image embeddings at 0.4/0.6 default weights. Audit on 5 queries showed **48% top-5 exemplar turnover** and rating-average improvements on 2/5 queries — the fusion is doing real work. Provider dropdown UX simplified (Advanced ▸ collapse).

**Cumulative across 2026-04-22 + 2026-04-23:** P1 Foundation, P2 S1+S2 (judge wired + UI + calibration loop), P3 S1 full (embeddings backfilled + retrieval fused), P5 dry-run wired. Live at www.listingelevate.com.

**What's live:**
- **V1 Prompt Lab** is the daily-driver iteration surface. Atlas routing, `kling-v2-6-pro` default, per-iteration SKU selector + corrected cost chip (~$0.36–$1.11/clip) + "Try another SKU" shortcut. TopNav renamed; Listings Lab hidden from nav but direct URLs preserved.
- **Gemini auto-judge is LIVE (`JUDGE_ENABLED=true` on Vercel prod).** Every new Lab render that finalizes triggers a fire-and-forget `judgeLabIteration` call (gemini-2.5-flash, ~21s latency, ~2¢/clip) that watches the clip + source photo and writes a structured 5-axis rubric (motion_faithfulness, geometry_coherence, room_consistency, hallucination_flags, confidence + overall) to `prompt_lab_iterations.judge_rating_json`. Verified end-to-end 2026-04-22 on iteration `1aecff42` — judge correctly caught "too slow push-in, missed curve left" as a motion defect (overall 4, motion_faithfulness 2, flags: `too_slow` + `other_motion_defect`).
- **Thompson router is ARMED BUT OFF (`USE_THOMPSON_ROUTER` unset).** Math kernel + migration 038 + `resolveDecisionAsync` + `router_shadow_log` inserts on every render all live. With the flag off, every render silently logs `{ sku, reason: "flag_off" }` alongside `{ static_sku }` — dry-run data accumulating for the P5 Session 2 (2026-04-30) A/B audit. Flipping `USE_THOMPSON_ROUTER=true` activates auto-routing (but there's <3 trials per bucket today, so it'd fall back to static for all buckets anyway).
- **Image embeddings backfilled + fused into retrieval.** 95 images (42 photos + 53 sessions) have `gemini-embedding-2` 768-dim vectors. Migration 035 updated `match_rated_examples` / `match_loser_examples` / `match_lab_recipes` to accept optional `query_image_embedding` + `text_weight`/`image_weight` (0.4/0.6 defaults, env-overridable via `IMAGE_EMBEDDING_TEXT_WEIGHT`/`IMAGE_EMBEDDING_IMAGE_WEIGHT`). Callers in `lib/prompt-lab.ts` + `lib/judge/neighbors.ts` now load the query session's image embedding and pass it. Listing branch stays text-only (no photo_id linkage on listing_scenes — P3 S2 task). Audit `docs/audits/retrieval-fusion-2026-04-23.md` verdict: "Image fusion IS surfacing different exemplars."
- **Judge chip + Override panel in IterationCard.** Every iteration with `judge_rating_overall` populated shows "🔍 Judge 4/5 · Motion 2 · Geom 5 · Room 5 · ⚠ flags · conf 5 [Override]" as a muted row. Override opens inline panel (sliders + flag checkboxes + reasoning/correction textareas, pre-filled from current judge output) that writes a `judge_calibration_examples` row. Next judge call in that same (room × movement) bucket loads up to 10 recent overrides as few-shot context — closes the calibration loop.
- **Rating Ledger side-by-side.** `/dashboard/rating-ledger` has a new Judge column with delta-based color coding (grey ≤1, amber 2, red ≥3) + "Show only disagreements" filter. Useful for spotting where the judge needs calibration.
- **Provider dropdown simplified.** Daily Lab view now shows SKU + cost only; Kling-native / Runway escape hatches hidden behind an "Advanced ▸" toggle.

**Migrations applied via Supabase MCP (all in prod):** 031 (SKU capture), 032 (cost_events provider widen), 033 (judge columns + calibration_examples table), 034 (image_embedding + HNSW), 035 (retrieval RPCs with image-fusion), 038 (router_bucket_stats + router_shadow_log), 040 (SKU-required-at-finalize CHECK), 041 (iteration order_id + per-version sequences + trigger).

**Pre-cooked design branches (FINAL, integrated into shipped code today; branches preserved for reference):**
- `session/p2-rubric-design` — judge rubric (7 Qs resolved)
- `session/p3-embedding-preflight` — embedding provider decision (5 Qs resolved)
- `session/p5-thompson-design` — Thompson design (6 Qs resolved)

**What's NOT done yet (scheduled):**
- P3 Session 2 (2026-04-26): hybrid retrieval (dense + BM25 sparse + image, 3-way fused) + RetrievalPanel UI with match-percentage
- P3 Session 3 (2026-04-27): cross-encoder reranker pass on top of hybrid
- P4 (2026-04-28 → 29): scale hardening (per-photo Gemini enrichment on legacy, MMR diversity, hallucination-risk propagation)
- P5 Session 2 (2026-04-30 → 05-01): flip `USE_THOMPSON_ROUTER=true`, A/B audit, prod rollout decision
- P6 (2026-05-02): active learning + pairwise UX
- P7 (ongoing ~2026-05-05): promote-to-prod runbook

**Known carry-overs:**
- Pre-existing `/api/cron/poll-listing-iterations` error firing every minute for 48h+ (unrelated to any 2026-04-22 work; standing bug worth investigating).
- JUDGE_MODEL env can override `gemini-2.5-flash` back to `gemini-3-flash-preview` if that tier opens up.
- Full V1 smoke render (P1 Task 12) not explicitly run — judge verification on iteration 1aecff42 exercised the full pipeline path downstream of clip delivery, which is equivalent.

## Known gotchas

- **File-revert mystery in this repo** — during one session in 2026-04-13, file edits got silently reverted by an unknown process. Dormant since but watch for it. Commit often; keep a memory backup of in-flight work.
- **Production `properties.selected_duration` column does not exist yet.** Phase C pipeline reads optimistically with `maybeSingle()` and logs a warn + defaults to 60s until the order-form persistence work lands.
- **Atlas pricing** for `v2.6-pro` was initially miscalibrated at 2× under. Now `$0.60/clip` confirmed. Other SKUs may still need invoice verification — see [`specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md) Phase CI notes.
- **Kling v3 shake issue** on single-image shots. Stability prefix (`CAMERA_STABILITY_PREFIX`) is applied only for `kling-v3-*` models after DQ; Atlas negative prompt is always applied.
- **Lab → prod promotion has never been used** — 0 overrides ever promoted per Phase M.1 audit. Signal is there but no one is turning recipes into active router directives. M.2 and B close this.
- **Prod scene embeddings** — all 24/24 scenes embedded after M.2 backfill (2026-04-21). Backfill script widened to all prod scenes (not just rated ones).

## Oliver's standing preferences

- Plain language, bottom-line, no jargon.
- **No git push / no Vercel deploy without explicit in-turn permission for destructive operations.** Blanket "direct-to-main" granted for routine current work — still ask on anything destructive (force push, rebase pushed history, column drops, file deletion outside the `archive/` pattern).
- Higher models (Opus) for design/audit tasks; Sonnet for implementation; Haiku only for trivial mechanical work.
- Cost tracking is first-class — every API call logs a `cost_event`, even $0 ones. Don't ship with null/0 cost fields on finalized renders.
- Efficient execution. Minimal questions. Pick the best path and proceed.

## Cross-repo state

Three working copies exist on disk, all pointing at the same GitHub repo (`theolivercollins/reelready`) on different branches:

| Path | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline` | `main` | **active** — all work lands here |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-finances` | `finances-tab` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `66135be` (finances-tab work, mid-April). Useful only as reference. |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-ui` | `ui-redesign` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `e54b2f2`. Older than main. |

Snapshots of the stale forks' `docs/` live under [`archive/forks/`](./archive/forks/) for historical record.

## Next session checklist

When you pick this up:
1. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) → this file → [`state/PROJECT-STATE.md`](./state/PROJECT-STATE.md) → [`plans/back-on-track-plan.md`](./plans/back-on-track-plan.md).
2. Confirm with Oliver whether Phase M.2 is re-dispatched or skipped before starting implementation.
3. Any push to `main` → append a line to "Recent shipping log" above AND update "Right now" if the next action changed.
4. Use the `superpowers` plugin for planning + execution. Don't freelance.
