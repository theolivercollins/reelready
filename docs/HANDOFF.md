## Right now

**Phase M.2 shipped. DA.1 Gemini-eyes merged to main (2026-04-21).** Director now receives `motion_headroom` booleans from Gemini 3 Flash per photo and hard-bans geometrically impossible camera moves. Window D Round 1 audit (2026-04-21) confirmed **Phase B cannot be auto-derived from existing signal** — only 32% of 170 rated iterations are SKU-granular (Phase 2.8 Lab only), and no (room × movement) bucket has ≥3 iterations on a single SKU. See `docs/audits/router-coverage-2026-04-21.md`. Current next action: **Phase B — targeted rating session** on the quota-high buckets (kitchen, living_room, master_bedroom, exterior_front, aerial) using the script's coverage output to scope the grid minimally. `lib/providers/router.ts` stays on intuition-based routing until real signal lands.

## Plan state

Phases of the back-on-track plan (full spec at [`specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md)):

| Phase | Status | What |
|---|---|---|
| A — Lab UX spine | shipped | `NextActionBanner`, priority chips, optimistic updates |
| M.1 — Director-prompt trace audit | shipped | Learning loop verified working-with-gaps; full audit at [`audits/ML-AUDIT-2026-04-20.md`](./audits/ML-AUDIT-2026-04-20.md) |
| DQ — Director concise prompts | shipped | `DIRECTOR_SYSTEM` enforces ≤120/≤250 char prompts, stability prefix `kling-v3-*`-only, paired auto-route to `kling-v2-1-pair`, default model flipped to `kling-v2-6-pro` |
| DM — Dev/Legacy merge | shipped | One unified Lab UI, native Kling provider added (Oliver's pre-paid credits), Compare demoted, legacy Lab routes retired |
| CI — Cost integrity | shipped (CI.1–CI.5) | Model-aware Claude pricing, OpenAI embedding tracking, Shotstack per-minute, failed-render policy, dashboard drill-down |
| C — Production end-to-end | shipped | Router `ProviderDecision`, base64 → URL, duration-aware director, lazy failover Kling → Atlas |
| M.2 — ML consolidation | ✅ shipped | SKU capture, dead code removal, prod embedding backfill |
| B — Model head-to-head | audit complete (2026-04-21); blocked on targeted rating session | Per Window D audit: existing 170 ratings insufficient (32 buckets, 0 winners, 32% SKU-granular). Narrowed plan: targeted grid on 5 quota-high buckets — seed + render + rate, then re-run `scripts/build-router-table.ts` to emit a real table |

## Known gotchas

- **File-revert mystery in this repo** — during one session in 2026-04-13, file edits got silently reverted by an unknown process. Dormant since but watch for it. Commit often; keep a memory backup of in-flight work.
- **Production `properties.selected_duration` column does not exist yet.** Phase C pipeline reads optimistically with `maybeSingle()` and logs a warn + defaults to 60s until the order-form persistence work lands.
- **Atlas pricing** for `v2.6-pro` was initially miscalibrated at 2× under. Now `$0.60/clip` confirmed. Other SKUs may still need invoice verification — see [`specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`](./specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md) Phase CI notes.
- **Kling v3 shake issue** on single-image shots. Stability prefix (`CAMERA_STABILITY_PREFIX`) is applied only for `kling-v3-*` models after DQ; Atlas negative prompt is always applied.
- **Lab → prod promotion has never been used** — 0 overrides ever promoted per Phase M.1 audit. Signal is there but no one is turning recipes into active router directives. M.2 and B close this.
- **Prod scene embeddings** — all 24/24 scenes embedded after M.2 backfill (2026-04-21). Backfill script widened to all prod scenes (not just rated ones).

## Oliver's standing preferences

- Plain language, bottom-line, no jargon.
- **No git push / no Vercel deploy without explicit in-turn permission for destructive operations.** Blanket "direct-to-main" granted for routine current work — still ask on anything destructive (force push, rebase pushed history, column drops, file deletion outside the `archive/` pattern).
- Higher models (Opus) for design/audit tasks; Sonnet for implementation; Haiku only for trivial mechanical work.
- Cost tracking is first-class — every API call logs a `cost_event`, even $0 ones. Don't ship with null/0 cost fields on finalized renders.
- Efficient execution. Minimal questions. Pick the best path and proceed.

## Cross-repo state

Three working copies exist on disk, all pointing at the same GitHub repo (`theolivercollins/reelready`) on different branches:

| Path | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline` | `main` | **active** — all work lands here |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-finances` | `finances-tab` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `66135be` (finances-tab work, mid-April). Useful only as reference. |
| `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline-ui` | `ui-redesign` | stale side-branch clone — do NOT push. Latest commit `e54b2f2`. Older than main. |

Snapshots of the stale forks' `docs/` live under [`archive/forks/`](./archive/forks/) for historical record.

## Next session checklist

When you pick this up:
1. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) → this file → [`state/PROJECT-STATE.md`](./state/PROJECT-STATE.md) → [`plans/back-on-track-plan.md`](./plans/back-on-track-plan.md).
2. Confirm with Oliver whether Phase M.2 is re-dispatched or skipped before starting implementation.
3. Any push to `main` → append a line to "Recent shipping log" above AND update "Right now" if the next action changed.
4. Use the `superpowers` plugin for planning + execution. Don't freelance.
