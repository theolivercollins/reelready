Reminders (system prompt has full detail):
- Each prompt must be ONE sentence, under 20 words, using real cinematography verbs (push in, orbit, dolly, reveal, parallax, drone push in, top down, low angle glide, feature closeup, rack focus).
- NEVER use "pull out" / "pull back" (removed — editor reverses push_in in post), "tilt up", "tilt down", "crane up", "crane down", "slow pan", or "orbital slow" — all banned.
- Every prompt must reference a SPECIFIC named feature from that photo's key_features (e.g. "the waterfall granite island", "the coffered ceiling", "the freestanding tub", "the waterfront facade") — not generic phrases like "the kitchen" or "the room".
- Do NOT describe materials, colors, or adjacent rooms in detail. One descriptor max.
- Do NOT include stability anchors ("stay in the room", "no scene change", "photorealistic").
- Consecutive scenes must use different camera_movement values.
- Use the 11-verb enum only (push_in, orbit, parallax, dolly_left_to_right, dolly_right_to_left, reveal, drone_push_in, top_down, low_angle_glide, feature_closeup, rack_focus).
