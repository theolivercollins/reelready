## Product

**Listing Elevate** is a real estate AI video automation pipeline. Agents upload 10–60 property photos; the system produces cinematic walkthrough clips via Claude vision analysis + shot planning + multi-provider generation (Kling / Runway / Luma). Individual clips are the deliverable today; Shotstack assembly is wired in and active when `SHOTSTACK_API_KEY` is set.

- **Live URL:** `https://www.listingelevate.com` (Vercel custom domain)
- **Legacy URLs:** `reelready-eight.vercel.app` (works), historic: Real Estate Pipeline, ReelReady, Key Frame
- **Repo:** `theolivercollins/reelready` on GitHub (rename pending, doesn't block)
- **Local path:** `/Users/oliverhelgemo/real-estate-pipeline`
- **Primary user:** Oliver (`oliver@recasi.com`, `user_profiles.role='admin'`). Sole admin. Agent signup via magic link exists; no approval gate yet.

## Communication preferences

Oliver wants plain language, bottom-line answers, no jargon, direct action. Things flagged as annoying:
- Long responses with headers and bullet lists when a sentence would do
- Presenting A/B/C options when one has a clear vote
- Restating a plan before executing it
- Emotional adjectives in status updates
- Asking "do you want me to…" when he already said go

**New rule (2026-04-14):** Do not push to GitHub or deploy to Vercel without explicit permission in the same turn. Local commits are fine. Wait for "push", "deploy", "ship it", etc.

---

## Pipeline stages (main product — unchanged this session)

`lib/pipeline.ts` `runPipeline(propertyId)` runs in order:

1. **Stamp `pipeline_started_at`** — cron uses this for timing, not `properties.created_at`
2. **Prompt revision snapshot** — hashes every system prompt, inserts `prompt_revisions` row if changed
3. **Intake** — verify ≥5 photos
4. **Analysis** — Claude Sonnet 4.6 vision per photo: room, quality, aesthetic, depth, key_features, composition, video_viable, suggested_motion
5. **Style guide** — built and stored on `properties.style_guide` but NOT injected into director (bloat regression)
6. **Scripting** — director picks 10–16 scenes. PAST GENERATIONS block (winners ≥4, losers ≤2, last 30 days) injected as in-context learning
7. **Generation SUBMIT** — fire-and-forget. Submits to provider, persists `provider_task_id`, exits in ~30s
8. **Cron finalize** — `/api/cron/poll-scenes` every minute: downloads clips, records cost, flips property to complete. Shotstack stitches if key is set.

Preflight QA and inline QC were deleted on 2026-04-14 AM. They were regressing output.

### Camera vocabulary (11 verbs + 8 cinematographer sub-variants)

Active: `push_in · pull_out · orbit · parallax · dolly_left_to_right · dolly_right_to_left · reveal · drone_push_in · drone_pull_back · top_down · low_angle_glide · feature_closeup`

Banned (not emitted): `tilt_up · tilt_down · crane_up · crane_down · slow_pan · orbital_slow`. Vertical-only motions don't map to real-estate shot types.

Sub-variants (prompt-level styles within an existing verb): Straight Push, Straight Push Curve, Straight Push with Rise, Orbiting Detail Rise and Drop, Cowboy Lift, PTF Orbit, Detail Slider, Top Down Detail.

### Reveal hardening (shipped 2026-04-14 PM)

`lib/prompts/director.ts`: reveal prompts must name a foreground that appears verbatim in the photo's `key_features`. A reveal whose foreground is invented (e.g. "reveal past the kitchen island corner" when the photo has no island) is banned. Director falls back to push_in or dolly.

### Scene allocation quotas

Kitchen 2–3 (hard min 2, pick 3 with 3+ viable photos w/ depth=high or aesthetic≥8), living_room 2 (hard min 2), master_bedroom 2 (hard min 2), dining 1, pool 2 (if present), lanai 1, bathroom 1–2, exterior_front 2–3, aerial 1–2, bedrooms 1–2 each, extras 1–2 total.

### Router

Movement first, room type as tiebreaker. `lib/providers/router.ts`.

- Runway: `push_in · pull_out · feature_closeup · drone_* · top_down · orbit (exterior)`
- Kling: `dolly_* · parallax · reveal · low_angle_glide · orbit (interior)`

## Phase 2.8 — Prompt Lab Listings (shipped 2026-04-20 evening)

A second-generation Lab at `/dashboard/development/lab`, distinct from the legacy single-photo session Lab at `/dashboard/development/prompt-lab` (which is preserved and still functional). Listings group multiple photos, the director plans a shot sequence (scenes), and each scene carries iterations rendered via Atlas Cloud.

### Hierarchy

`Listing → Photos → Scenes → Iterations`

- **Listing** — one real-estate property. Carries a name, default model, status, notes, archived flag, and a total cost rollup.
- **Photo** — one uploaded image. Gets analyzed by Claude (room type, aesthetic, depth, key features, composition, suggested motion). Embedding stored on the row.
- **Scene** — director-planned shot. `photo_id` (start) + optional `end_photo_id` (pair). Carries `director_prompt`, `director_intent` (model-agnostic structured intent), `refinement_notes` (accumulated directives), `chat_messages` JSONB, `use_end_frame` toggle, `archived` flag.
- **Iteration** — a single render of a scene. One per model when you "Generate all". Carries `director_prompt` (snapshot at render time), `model_used`, `provider_task_id`, `clip_url`, `rating`, `rating_reasons` (tag array), `user_comment`, `chat_messages` JSONB (legacy — now uses scene chat), `archived`, `cost_cents`.

### Provider: Atlas Cloud (replaces Kling/Runway/Luma for Lab)

Atlas Cloud is a multi-model aggregator. One API key, one endpoint, six Kling SKUs registered:

| Key | Slug | Price | End-frame | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kling-v3-pro` | `kwaivgi/kling-v3.0-pro/image-to-video` | $0.095 | yes | Selectable; known shake issue on single-image |
| `kling-v3-std` | `kwaivgi/kling-v3.0-std/image-to-video` | $0.071 | yes | Cheap exploration |
| `kling-v2-6-pro` | `kwaivgi/kling-v2.6-pro/image-to-video` | $0.060 | yes | **Default** (changed 2026-04-20 based on rated-iteration signal). HOT-tagged, smoother motion |
| `kling-v2-1-pair` | `kwaivgi/kling-v2.1-i2v-pro/start-end-frame` | $0.076 | yes | Purpose-built for paired scenes |
| `kling-v2-master` | `kwaivgi/kling-v2.0-i2v-master` | $0.221 | **no** | Premium; single-frame only |
| `kling-o3-pro` | `kwaivgi/kling-video-o3-pro/image-to-video` | $0.095 | yes | Newest generation |

Wan 2.7 registered briefly, removed 2026-04-20 evening. `lib/providers/atlas.ts::ATLAS_MODELS` is the server-side source of truth; `src/lib/labModels.ts` mirrors it for the UI.

### Lifecycle + crons

Fire-and-forget does not survive Vercel lambda termination, so the listings Lab runs on two crons:

1. `/api/cron/poll-listing-lifecycle` (every minute, `maxDuration=300`)
   - Picks up listings at `status='analyzing'` (limit 3/tick) — runs `analyzeListingPhotos` (Claude vision per photo, parallel, stores embedding)
   - Picks up listings at `status='directing'` (limit 5/tick) — runs `directListingScenes` (Sonnet 4.6 with recipe + exemplar + loser retrieval), flips to `status='ready_to_render'`
   - Failures mark listing `status='failed'` so the UI stops spinning
2. `/api/cron/poll-listing-iterations` (every minute) — polls Atlas for rendering iterations, downloads clip URL, flips to `rendered`, logs cost to `cost_events` (property_id=null, scope='lab_listing')

### Director (lists listings) — recipe-driven (restored 2026-04-20)

`lib/prompt-lab-listings.ts::directListingScenes` injects three retrieval blocks into the Sonnet user prompt alongside `buildDirectorUserPrompt`:

1. **Recipe match** — top matching `prompt_lab_recipes` by cosine distance (<0.35) per photo, deduped across photos, capped at 5. Gives the director curated templates from past promoted winners.
2. **Past winners** — top 4★+ iterations from `v_rated_pool` (unified Lab sessions + prod ratings + listing iterations), capped at 5.
3. **Past losers** — bottom 2★ iterations, capped at 3.

Retrieval is best-effort; a failing RPC logs and continues. Photo embedding is read off `prompt_lab_listing_photos.embedding` (parsed with `fromPgVector`).

### End-frame pairing

Director returns `end_photo_id` per scene when it wants a pair. `resolveSceneEndFrame` returns the URL if resolvable, else null (no more center-crop fallback — dropped 2026-04-20). Scene carries `use_end_frame` boolean; backfilled `false` for existing scenes where `end_photo_id IS NULL`. UI has a per-scene on/off toggle.

Director prompt explicitly tells Claude that single-image i2v is the right default for push-ins, top-downs, and feature closeups — don't force a pair.

### Shake mitigation (Kling v3 issue)

Kling v3.0-pro renders visibly shakier than v2. Two levers applied on every render:

- **Positive prefix** injected by render.ts: `"LOCKED-OFF CAMERA on a gimbal-stabilized Steadicam rig. Smooth motorized dolly motion only. Zero camera shake, zero handheld jitter, tripod-stable framing."` — idempotent (skipped if already present)
- **Negative prompt** field on `AtlasSubmitBody`: `"shaky camera, handheld, wobble, vibration, jitter, camera shake, rolling shutter, unstable motion"` (default on every request)

### Rating + reasons

Rating remains 1–5★ on iterations. Clicking a star opens `RatingReasonsModal` — user picks structured tags from a fixed taxonomy (`lib/rating-taxonomy.ts`):

- **Positive (4–5★)**: good_pacing, clean_motion, on_brand, excellent_composition, accurate_to_photo, cinematic_energy
- **Negative (1–3★)**: camera_shake, too_fast, too_slow, boring_motion, hallucinated_geometry, hallucinated_objects, warped_text, flicker, jumpy, overexposed, underexposed, color_cast, bad_framing, subject_drift, end_frame_lurch
- **other** (escape hatch, rely on comment for detail)

Reasons persist to `prompt_lab_listing_scene_iterations.rating_reasons TEXT[]`. Rendered as pill chips on the iteration card. Intended to feed retrieval/autonomous iterator with richer signal than stars alone.

### Unified scene chat (Haiku 4.5 + streaming + two tools)

`POST /api/admin/prompt-lab/listings/:id/scenes/:sceneId/chat` — SSE stream. Haiku 4.5 sees the full scene state: director prompt, refinement notes, every iteration's model / prompt / rating / reasons / comment / archive state. User can reference iterations by # naturally.

Two tools:
- **`save_future_instruction(instruction)`** — appends to `scene.refinement_notes`. Concatenated onto the prompt at next render.
- **`update_director_prompt(new_prompt)`** — rewrites `scene.director_prompt` directly. UI surfaces the change via a dismissible "Director prompt rewritten" banner and triggers a reload.

Stream events: `text` (delta), `saved_instruction`, `prompt_updated`, `done`, `error`. Client consumer in `src/lib/labListingsApi.ts::chatSceneStream`.

Per-iteration chat still works but the SceneCard no longer surfaces a button for it (single scene thread is the primary flow).

### Scene + iteration archive

- `prompt_lab_listing_scenes.archived` BOOLEAN (migration 027) — ShotPlanTable hides by default with "Show archived scenes (N)" toggle; archived scenes skipped by Render-all
- `prompt_lab_listing_scene_iterations.archived` BOOLEAN (migration 026) — iteration list hides by default; "Show archived (N)" per-scene toggle; archived stays in DB so rating signal survives

### UI: master-detail layout

`src/pages/dashboard/LabListingDetail.tsx`:

- **Header**: listing name + status chip + model chip + notes + stats strip (scenes rendered/total, iterations, cost w/ per-model breakdown, photos count w/ show/hide, created date)
- **ShotPlanTable**: one compact row per non-archived scene (thumbnail + # + room + movement + iteration count + best rating + total cost + status chip). Click a row to focus that scene.
- **Focused SceneCard**: full interaction surface for the selected scene. Newest iteration auto-expanded; all older iterations rendered as one-line `IterationCollapsed` rows, click to expand into `IterationExpanded` (video + actions + comment + rating reasons).

### Generate all models + side-by-side compare

`GenerateAllModal` (scene card → "Generate all" button) — checkboxes per model, running cost total, warns when pair-incompatible models are selected with end-frame on. Calls `POST /render` with `models: string[]` → one iteration per model in a single request.

`CompareModal` (appears when scene has ≥2 playable iterations) — side-by-side video grid labeled A/B/C... Click stars to rate inline.

### Data model additions (migrations 023–027)

- **`prompt_lab_listings`** — id, name, created_by, model_name, notes, status ('analyzing' | 'directing' | 'ready_to_render' | 'rendering' | 'failed'), archived, total_cost_cents, created_at
- **`prompt_lab_listing_photos`** — id, listing_id, photo_index, image_url, image_path, analysis_json, embedding vector(1536), created_at
- **`prompt_lab_listing_scenes`** — id, listing_id, scene_number, photo_id, end_photo_id, end_image_url, room_type, camera_movement, director_prompt, director_intent JSONB, refinement_notes TEXT, chat_messages JSONB, use_end_frame BOOLEAN, archived BOOLEAN, created_at
- **`prompt_lab_listing_scene_iterations`** — id, scene_id, iteration_number, director_prompt, model_used, provider_task_id, clip_url, rating, tags, user_comment, rating_reasons TEXT[], cost_cents, status, render_error, chat_messages JSONB, archived BOOLEAN, embedding, created_at
- **`v_rated_pool`** view extended with a 3rd UNION branch so new listing iterations flow into unified retrieval alongside legacy Lab sessions and prod ratings.

## Prompt Lab — legacy single-photo subsystem (shipped 2026-04-14 PM, still live)

An admin-only iterative prompt-refinement workbench at `/dashboard/development/prompt-lab`. Separate from production — changes here do not touch `lib/pipeline.ts` or production director output. Superseded by Phase 2.8 listings for multi-photo workflows but preserved because its recipes and rated history feed the unified retrieval pool that the listings director now reads.

### Why

Only 7 rated scenes in prod (0 kitchen, 0 living). Can't tune director prompts from data that doesn't exist. Lab generates that data on-demand without running a full property.

### Capabilities

**Upload & generate:** drag-drop multi-file upload on the list page. Each image becomes a session; with auto-analyze on, `PHOTO_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM` + `DIRECTOR_SYSTEM` run per session in parallel. Result: the proposed camera_movement + prompt for every uploaded photo in one shot.

**Batches:** sessions can carry a `batch_label` (e.g. "Smith property"). List view groups by batch. Session cards are draggable — drop on another batch header to move, drop on the "create new batch" zone at the bottom to make a new group. Click a batch title to rename all its sessions at once.

**Filter chips per batch:** All / Need to start / In progress / Completed. "Need to start" means no admin feedback yet (no rating, tag, comment, or refinement). "Completed" means any iteration rated 4★+ OR any iteration became the source of a recipe.

**Card states on the list view:**
- `Rendering` amber pill over thumbnail while any iteration has `provider_task_id` set + no `clip_url` + no error
- `Generation approval needed` sky blue banner when latest iteration has a rendered clip with no rating
- `Iteration approval needed` teal banner when latest iteration has a director prompt but no clip yet
- `✓ Completed` emerald badge (top-right) when any iteration rated 4★+ or promoted to recipe
- Auto-refreshes every 15s when any session is active (visibility-gated)
- **Card sorting within batches** by priority: Generation approval needed → Iteration approval needed → Rendering → rest → Completed

Banners are based on the LATEST iteration per session (not the union of all iterations). Fixes false "generation approval" when user has moved past old unrated clips to new iterations.

**Detail view (`/dashboard/development/prompt-lab/:sessionId`):** click-to-edit label in header; iteration stack with newest on top. Latest iteration has 2px foreground border + "Latest · active" pill. Older iterations muted. Each iteration card shows analysis summary, director prompt, retrieval chips ("Based on N similar wins" / "Recipe · archetype"), render controls on latest, rating widget + chat.

**Render (async — shipped 2026-04-14 PM, concurrency guard 2026-04-15):** fire-and-forget. Render endpoint submits to Kling/Runway and stores `provider_task_id`. `/api/cron/poll-lab-renders` runs every minute in two phases: Phase 1 submits queued renders when a slot opens, Phase 2 finalizes in-flight renders (downloads clips, uploads to Supabase Storage `property-videos/prompt-lab/<session>/<iteration>.mp4`, sets `clip_url`). Safe to navigate away mid-render. Provider picker (Auto / Kling / Runway) on each render control.

**Kling concurrency guard (shipped 2026-04-15):** `countKlingInFlight()` checks Lab + prod in-flight Kling jobs against 4-concurrent cap. Auto mode falls back to Runway when Kling is full. Explicit Kling selection queues the render (`render_queued_at` column, migration 012). Queued renders auto-submit when a slot opens; 30-min expiry. Violet "Queued — waiting for slot" UI indicator.

**Re-render with different provider (shipped 2026-04-17):** "Try with: Kling / Runway" buttons on iterations with clips. Endpoint `api/admin/prompt-lab/rerender.ts` clones the iteration and submits to the specified provider. Each provider attempt gets its own iteration with its own rating, so recipes capture the winning provider.

**Rating on any iteration (fixed 2026-04-15):** rating widget no longer gated on `isLatest` — can rate older iterations. "Ready for approval" banner clears once any iteration in a session has feedback.

**Save rating** button (separate from Refine) persists rating + tags + comment without forcing a new iteration.

**Refine from any iteration (shipped 2026-04-20):** Refine controls (chat + "Refine → new iteration" button) no longer gated on `isLatest`. Can branch from any older iteration; label says "(will branch from this iteration)".

**4★ backup recipes (shipped 2026-04-20):** Rating 4★ auto-promotes to recipe as a "backup" (archetype prefixed `backup_`, `rating_at_promotion=4`). 4★+ marks session as completed (was 5★ only). Manual "Promote to recipe" button shows on 4★+ iterations. Both primary (5★) and backup (4★) recipes feed retrieval.

**Organize mode + archive (shipped 2026-04-17):** "Organize" button toggles multi-select mode with checkboxes on session cards. Selection actions: group into batch, move to batch, archive, unarchive. Collapse chevrons on batch headers hide/show card grids. Sessions filtered out when archived; "Show archived" toggle. Grey "Archived" badge on archived cards. Migration 013: `archived boolean` on `prompt_lab_sessions`.

### Learning loop (the ML part — shipped 2026-04-14 PM, extended 2026-04-15+)

Three layered mechanisms. Retrieval now pulls from a unified pool of Lab + production ratings.

**1. Similarity retrieval (few-shot)** — every iteration's analysis gets embedded via OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dim) and stored in `prompt_lab_iterations.embedding`. Production scenes also embed on insert via `embedScene(sceneId)` in `lib/db.ts`. On each new analyze, the new photo's embedding queries `match_rated_examples` RPC (unified — pools Lab iterations + prod `scene_ratings` with `rating >= 4` and rating-weighted cosine distance). Top-5 exemplars (with tags/comment/refinement) are injected into the director user message as a "PAST WINNERS ON STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR PHOTOS" block. Same retrieval runs on Refine. The old `match_lab_iterations` RPC still exists in DB but is unused.

**Negative signal (shipped 2026-04-15):** `match_loser_examples` RPC pools low-rated (<=2★) Lab iterations + prod scene_ratings. `retrieveSimilarLosers` + `renderLoserBlock` inject an "AVOID THESE PATTERNS" block into the director user prompt alongside winners. Both analyze.ts and refine.ts call loser retrieval in parallel with winner retrieval. Rose-colored "Avoiding N losers" chip in Lab UI.

**"DO NOT REPEAT" block (shipped 2026-04-15–19):** when re-analyzing a session, all prior non-5★ prompts are injected as a "DO NOT REPEAT" block so the director avoids repeating failed approaches.

**2. Recipe library** — `prompt_lab_recipes` table keyed by archetype + room_type + camera_movement. Auto-populated on rating=5 unconditionally (dedup removed 2026-04-17 — every 5★ now promotes). Rating=4 also auto-promotes as backup recipe (archetype prefixed `backup_`, `rating_at_promotion=4`; shipped 2026-04-20). Manual "Promote to recipe" button pre-fills `room_camera_YYMMDD-slug` archetype pattern. Green success banner for auto-promote confirmation. When a new photo's embedding matches a recipe within distance 0.35 on the same room_type, director gets a "VALIDATED RECIPE MATCH" block instructing it to use the template verbatim after feature substitution. `times_applied` increments per use. Recipes UI at `/dashboard/development/prompt-lab/recipes`: list, edit, archive, delete.

**3. Rule mining + proposals** — `/dashboard/development/proposals` page. "Run rule mining" aggregates rated Lab iterations by (room × movement × provider) bucket, passes winners + losers + evidence to Claude with `DIRECTOR_PATCH_SYSTEM`, which returns a unified diff + per-change citations. Admin reviews (diff + bucket evidence), clicks Apply → new `lab_prompt_overrides` row. Lab's director resolves the override at call time; production director does NOT consult overrides. Reject is one click, audit-logged on the proposal row.

### Data model

- **`prompt_lab_sessions`** — id, created_by, image_url, image_path, label, archetype, batch_label, archived (boolean, migration 013), created_at
- **`prompt_lab_iterations`** — id, session_id, iteration_number, analysis_json, analysis_prompt_hash, director_output_json, director_prompt_hash, clip_url, provider, provider_task_id, render_submitted_at, render_queued_at (migration 012), render_error, cost_cents, rating, tags, user_comment, refinement_instruction, embedding vector(1536), embedding_model, retrieval_metadata, created_at
- **`scenes`** — (production) now includes `embedding vector(1536)` + HNSW partial index (m=16, ef_construction=64, where not null) via migration 009
- **`prompt_lab_recipes`** — id, archetype, room_type, camera_movement, provider, composition_signature, prompt_template, source_iteration_id, rating_at_promotion, promoted_by, promoted_at, times_applied, embedding vector(1536), status
- **`lab_prompt_overrides`** — prompt_name, body, body_hash, is_active (UNIQUE partial index on active rows)
- **`lab_prompt_proposals`** — prompt_name, base_body_hash, proposed_diff, proposed_body, evidence JSONB, rationale, status, reviewed_at, reviewed_by
- **`dev_session_notes`** — session_date, objective, accomplishments (for the Development dashboard working log)

RPC helpers: `match_rated_examples` (unified retrieval), `match_loser_examples` (negative signal), `match_lab_recipes`, `recipe_exists_near`. Legacy: `match_lab_iterations` (unused).

## Dashboard nav (reorg shipped 2026-04-14 PM)

TopNav sub-nav now: Overview · Pipeline · Listings · Logs · Finances · **Development** (dropdown) · Settings.

Development dropdown: Overview · Learning · Prompt Lab · Recipes · Proposals.

Legacy routes `/dashboard/learning` and `/dashboard/prompt-lab` 404 — all moved under `/dashboard/development/*`.

Development landing (`/dashboard/development`) shows:
- Session notes — per-session objective + accomplishments log (CRUD via `/api/admin/dev-notes`)
- Quick-link cards to Learning, Prompt Lab, Recipes, Proposals
- Prompt revision changelog summary (latest version per prompt)
- Static "How it works" reference: pipeline stages, router, vocabulary, key tables

## Providers (credit status 2026-04-19)

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Atlas Cloud** | Active (Lab listings) | 6 Kling SKUs registered (v2.6-pro default, v3-pro, v3-std, v2.1-pair, v2-master, o3-pro). Env: `ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY`, `ATLAS_VIDEO_MODEL` (default `kling-v2-6-pro`, changed 2026-04-20). Accepts `negative_prompt` + `cfg_scale` per request. |
| Runway | Active (legacy Lab + prod) | URL-based image input. Fallback target when Kling is full |
| Kling (native) | Active (legacy Lab + prod) | 4-concurrent cap, auto-fallback to Runway, explicit queues with 30-min expiry |
| Luma | Coded, not wired | |
| Higgsfield | Scaffolded, not wired (deferred — see `docs/HIGGSFIELD-INTEGRATION.md`) | |
| Shotstack | Active if key set. Stage + prod keys exist in `.env` | |
| OpenAI | Embeddings for Lab + prod scene retrieval (unified pool). `OPENAI_API_KEY` live in Vercel prod + preview |
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (director), Claude Haiku 4.5 (scene chat, streaming via SSE) |

---

## Cost tracking

`cost_events` table, `recordCostEvent` helper in `lib/db.ts`. Every Claude call + Runway/Kling/Shotstack render logged with tokens / credits / units + cent estimates. Lab iterations include analysis + director + render cost in `prompt_lab_iterations.cost_cents` (rounded to int — non-int fractional cents caused a 500 early in the Lab build).

---

## Known bugs / gotchas

- **Runway ignores non-push motion** — router avoids sending those to Runway now; fallback path could still misroute.
- **Production pipeline base64 image input** — 4 places in `lib/pipeline.ts` still use base64 instead of URL. Lab is fixed; prod is not.
- **File-revert mystery** — unresolved. All Shotstack MVP files + the entire Lab build survived multiple sessions; probably dormant or specific to certain paths.
- **Prompt QA dead code** — `lib/prompts/prompt-qa.ts` + body of `runPreflightQA` in pipeline.ts still present. Never called. Prune later.

### Fixed since last refresh (2026-04-19 production-readiness merge)

- **`scene_ratings` cascade on rerun** — migration 014: denorm columns backfilled, FK switched to ON DELETE SET NULL, RPCs rebuilt with coalesce fallback. Oliver's "lost 7+ ratings" bug is fixed.
- **Failover too aggressive** — `lib/providers/errors.ts` classifies errors as permanent/capacity/transient/unknown. Only permanent errors trigger failover; capacity + transient retry same provider.
- **Shotstack cost not in `cost_events`** — migration 017 widened CHECK constraints for shotstack + openai providers. `recordCostEvent` now logs Shotstack renders.
- **Stale `needs_review` scenes (production)** — `api/scenes/[id]/resubmit.ts` provides manual single-scene resubmission with prompt editing + provider forcing. Dashboard resubmit buttons on PropertyDetail + Pipeline pages.
- **Refiner rationale contaminating losers retrieval** — migration 015: `refiner_rationale` column split from `user_comment`.
- **Lab→prod promotion flow missing** — BUILT. `api/admin/prompt-lab/promote-to-prod.ts` + `lib/prompts/resolve.ts` (`resolveProductionPrompt`). Migration 016: readiness view, promotion audit columns, source tracking on prompt_revisions.

### Fixed earlier (2026-04-15 through 2026-04-19)

- **Lab analyze >5MB photos** — `analyzeSingleImage` switched from base64 to URL-based Claude vision input.
- **Lab render >5MB photos** — `GenerateClipParams` extended with `sourceImageUrl`; Runway + Kling prefer URL over base64.
- **Rating on any iteration** — rating widget no longer gated on `isLatest`.
- **"Ready for approval" persists after rating** — fixed; banner clears once any iteration in a session has feedback.
- **Director repeats prompts** — new "DO NOT REPEAT" block injected with all prior non-5★ prompts when re-analyzing a session.

---

## What shipped 2026-04-20 (evening session — Phase 2.8 Lab Listings)

### Atlas Cloud + 6 Kling SKUs, Wan removed
- `lib/providers/atlas.ts::ATLAS_MODELS` registers kling-v3-pro, kling-v3-std, kling-v2-6-pro, kling-v2-1-pair (start-end-frame SKU), kling-v2-master, kling-o3-pro. Wan 2.7 dropped.
- `AtlasSubmitBody` carries `negative_prompt` + `cfg_scale`; `ATLAS_DEFAULT_NEGATIVE_PROMPT` applied every render.
- `AtlasModelDescriptor.endFrameField` gates end-frame support per-model (master i2v is null, all others `end_image`).
- Atlas output URL parser extended to handle `outputs: ["url"]` (array of strings) in addition to `Array<{url}>`; earlier version failed every completed render with "finished without an output URL".

### Listings Lab (migration 023)
- Multi-photo listing → scenes → iterations hierarchy. Director plans shots for the whole property in one pass.
- Cron-based lifecycle: `poll-listing-lifecycle` advances `analyzing → directing → ready_to_render`. `poll-listing-iterations` finalizes Atlas renders + logs cost_events (property_id=null, scope='lab_listing').
- Listing GET returns photos + scenes + iterations in one shot.

### Scene chat + iteration chat (migration 024, 026)
- Streaming SSE via Haiku 4.5. Two tools: `save_future_instruction` (appends to scene.refinement_notes), `update_director_prompt` (rewrites scene.director_prompt). User-facing "Pin" on user messages also appends to refinement_notes.
- `ChatPanel` shared component, used at scene level. Dismissable "Director prompt rewritten" banner. Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.
- System prompt sees every iteration's prompt / rating / reasons / comment — can pattern-match across iterations ("what worked in #1 and #4").
- Per-iteration chat endpoint still active for backward compat but UI no longer surfaces it.

### Rating reasons taxonomy (migration 026)
- `rating_reasons TEXT[]` on iterations.
- Fixed taxonomy in `lib/rating-taxonomy.ts`: 6 positive + 15 negative + "other".
- `RatingReasonsModal` opens on star click; polarity-appropriate tag list + optional comment.
- Reasons render as colored pills on iteration cards and feed into scene chat context.

### Scene + iteration archive (migrations 026, 027)
- Scene-level and iteration-level `archived` flags.
- ShotPlanTable hides archived scenes with "Show archived (N)" toggle; "Render all" skips them.
- IterationRow per-scene toggle for archived iterations; archived stays in DB so rating signal survives.

### End-frame toggle + stop auto-cropping (migration 025)
- Scene.`use_end_frame` BOOLEAN. Backfilled `false` for scenes where `end_photo_id IS NULL` (so existing crop-fallback scenes stop rendering with them).
- `resolveSceneEndFrame` no longer calls the crop fallback — unpaired → null endImageUrl.
- render.ts only passes endImageUrl when `use_end_frame && end_image_url`.
- Per-scene "End frame: on/off" chip in SceneCard.

### Kling v3 shake fix
- `CAMERA_STABILITY_PREFIX` prepended to every effective prompt in render.ts: `"LOCKED-OFF CAMERA on a gimbal-stabilized Steadicam rig. Smooth motorized dolly motion only. Zero camera shake..."`. Idempotent.
- `ATLAS_DEFAULT_NEGATIVE_PROMPT` on every request: `"shaky camera, handheld, wobble, vibration, jitter, camera shake, rolling shutter, unstable motion"`.

### Recipe + exemplar retrieval restored in listings director
- Phase 2.8 director was running rulebook-only — no retrieval from `prompt_lab_recipes` or `v_rated_pool`. Fixed.
- Per-photo: parse stored embedding → `retrieveMatchingRecipes` + `retrieveSimilarIterations` (4★+) + `retrieveSimilarLosers` (≤2★) → dedupe across photos → render blocks + append to `buildDirectorUserPrompt`.
- `renderRecipeBlock`, `renderExemplarBlock`, `renderLoserBlock` exported from `lib/prompt-lab.ts`. `fromPgVector` added to `lib/embeddings.ts`.
- Retrieval is best-effort; failures log and continue.

### Per-iteration actions (parity with legacy Lab)
- Regenerate (new iteration with this iteration's exact prompt — skips refinement_notes concat).
- Show full prompt (expand to see what actually rendered).
- Copy prompt to clipboard.
- Archive iteration (soft-hide, keeps signal).
- Delete iteration (permanent).
- Render endpoint accepts `source_iteration_id` for regenerate.

### Generate-all + Compare modals
- `GenerateAllModal` (scene card → "Generate all") — per-model checkboxes, live cost total, pair-incompatible warning. `POST /render` accepts `models: string[]`.
- `CompareModal` (auto-shows when ≥2 playable iterations) — side-by-side video grid labeled A/B/C... with inline star rating.

### Master-detail layout
- `LabListingDetail.tsx` rebuilt: header w/ stats strip → `ShotPlanTable` → focused `SceneCard`.
- Newest iteration auto-expanded; older iterations collapsed to one-line rows (click to expand).
- Photos gallery collapsed by default, toggled from the header.
- Dropped the vertical stack of N SceneCards that made navigation slow.

### Bug fixes
- Listing stuck at "analyzing" forever — fire-and-forget in POST /listings didn't survive Vercel lambda termination → replaced with cron-based lifecycle advancer.
- Director failing on Lab listings — user prompt was a raw JSON dump of analysis_json → switched to production's `buildDirectorUserPrompt` + injected retrieval blocks.
- Atlas renders marked failed with "finished without an output URL" — parser expected `Array<{url}>`, Atlas returns `Array<string>`. Extractor handles both shapes now.

---

## What shipped 2026-04-20 (morning — legacy Lab)

### Banner system overhaul
- "Ready for approval" renamed to **"Generation approval needed"** (sky blue)
- New **"Iteration approval needed"** banner (teal) — shows when latest iteration has a director prompt but no clip yet
- Banners now based on the LATEST iteration per session, not the union of all iterations. Fixes false "generation approval" when user has moved past old unrated clips to new iterations
- Card sorting within batches by priority: Generation approval needed → Iteration approval needed → Rendering → rest → Completed

### 4★ backup recipes
- Rating 4★ auto-promotes to recipe as a "backup" (archetype prefixed `backup_`, `rating_at_promotion=4`)
- 4★+ marks session as completed (was 5★ only)
- Manual "Promote to recipe" button shows on 4★+ iterations
- Both primary (5★) and backup (4★) recipes feed retrieval

### Refine from any iteration
- Refine controls (chat + "Refine → new iteration" button) no longer gated on `isLatest`
- Can branch from any older iteration; label says "(will branch from this iteration)"

### Recipe dedup fully removed
- Dropped `prompt_lab_recipes_source_iteration_unique` index from migration 015
- Every 5★ (and now 4★) creates a new recipe unconditionally

### Production readiness merge (from claude/review-listing-elevate-docs-NkMzb branch)
- Migration 014: scene_ratings denormalization (ratings survive property rerun, FK → ON DELETE SET NULL, denorm columns backfilled, RPCs rebuilt with coalesce fallback). Fixed: `rated_photo_key_features` type corrected from `text[]` to `jsonb`
- Migration 015: Lab ML integrity (refiner_rationale split from user_comment, completeness view)
- Migration 016: Lab→prod promotion (override readiness view, audit columns, source tracking on prompt_revisions)
- Migration 017: cost_events CHECK widened for shotstack + openai
- `lib/providers/errors.ts` — error classification (permanent/capacity/transient)
- `lib/prompts/resolve.ts` — resolveProductionPrompt reads Lab-promoted revisions
- `api/scenes/[id]/resubmit.ts` — manual scene resubmission
- `api/admin/prompt-lab/promote-to-prod.ts` — Lab→prod promotion endpoint
- `lib/pipeline.ts` — smart failover loop, Shotstack cost tracking, Lab-promoted director
- Dashboard UI: resubmit buttons on PropertyDetail + Pipeline

### Bug fixes (2026-04-20)
- Duplicate recipe 500 on double-click — wrapped in try/catch (then fully removed dedup)
- SyntaxError in sessions.ts from conflict resolution — fixed typeof expression

## What shipped 2026-04-15 through 2026-04-19 — reverse chronological

### Production-readiness merge (2026-04-19, commit 65dcc7d)
- **Migration 014: scene_ratings denormalization** — denorm columns (rated_prompt, rated_camera_movement, rated_room_type, rated_provider, rated_photo_key_features, rated_embedding, etc.), backfill from live join, FK→ON DELETE SET NULL, RPCs rebuilt with coalesce fallback. `rated_photo_key_features` typed as `jsonb` to match `photos.key_features`.
- **Migration 015: Lab ML integrity** — `refiner_rationale` column split from `user_comment` (stops contaminating losers retrieval), unique index on recipes per `source_iteration_id`, `prompt_lab_iterations_complete` convenience view.
- **Migration 016: Lab→prod promotion** — `lab_prompt_override_readiness` view (≥10 renders, avg ≥4★, winners ≥2× losers), promotion audit columns on `lab_prompt_overrides`, `source` + `source_override_id` on `prompt_revisions`.
- **Migration 017: cost_events widened** — CHECK constraints accept shotstack + openai providers and 'renders' unit_type.
- **`lib/providers/errors.ts`** — classifies provider errors as permanent/capacity/transient/unknown. Only permanent triggers failover; capacity + transient retry same provider.
- **`lib/prompts/resolve.ts`** — `resolveProductionPrompt(promptName, baseline)` reads Lab-promoted revisions from `prompt_revisions`. Production DIRECTOR_SYSTEM no longer hardcoded.
- **`api/scenes/[id]/resubmit.ts`** — manual single-scene resubmission with prompt editing + provider forcing.
- **`api/admin/prompt-lab/promote-to-prod.ts`** — GET lists overrides with readiness stats, POST promotes override to production `prompt_revisions`.
- **`lib/pipeline.ts`** — smart failover loop in `runGenerationSubmit` (permanent→failover, capacity/transient→retry), Shotstack cost tracking via `recordCostEvent`, `resolveProductionPrompt` for director.
- **Dashboard UI** — resubmit buttons on PropertyDetail + Pipeline pages for `needs_review` scenes.

### Organize mode + archive (2026-04-17)
- "Organize" button toggles multi-select mode with checkboxes on session cards
- Selection actions: group into batch, move to batch, archive, unarchive
- Collapse chevrons on batch headers — hide/show card grids
- Migration 013: `archived boolean` on prompt_lab_sessions
- Sessions filtered out when archived; "Show archived" toggle; grey "Archived" badge

### Re-render with different provider (2026-04-17)
- `api/admin/prompt-lab/rerender.ts`: clones iteration, submits to specified provider
- "Try with: Kling / Runway" buttons on iterations with clips
- Each provider attempt gets own iteration → own rating → recipe captures winning provider

### Recipe improvements (2026-04-17)
- Dedup removed: every 5★ now promotes to recipe unconditionally
- Auto-fill archetype: manual promote pre-fills `room_camera_YYMMDD-slug` pattern
- Green success banner for auto-promote confirmation (was using red error channel)

### Kling concurrency guard + render queue (2026-04-15)
- `countKlingInFlight()` checks Lab + prod in-flight Kling jobs
- Auto mode: falls back to Runway when Kling is full
- Explicit Kling: queues the render (migration 012: `render_queued_at`)
- Cron `poll-lab-renders.ts` rewritten with Phase 1 (submit queued) + Phase 2 (finalize in-flight)
- Queued renders auto-submit when slot opens, 30-min expiry
- Violet "Queued — waiting for slot" UI indicator

### Negative signal / losers retrieval (2026-04-15)
- Migration 011: `match_loser_examples` RPC — pools low-rated (<=2★) Lab iterations + prod scene_ratings
- `retrieveSimilarLosers` + `renderLoserBlock` — "AVOID THESE PATTERNS" block in director prompt
- Rose-colored "Avoiding N losers" chip in Lab UI

### Unified embeddings (2026-04-15)
- Migration 009: `scenes.embedding vector(1536)` + HNSW partial index
- Migration 010: Extended `match_rated_examples` to return tags/comment/refinement
- `embedScene(sceneId)` in lib/db.ts — embeds each scene on insert
- Backfill script `scripts/backfill-scene-embeddings.ts` — ran, 7 prod scenes embedded
- Lab retrieval switched from `match_lab_iterations` to `match_rated_examples` — unified pool of Lab + prod ratings

### Bug fixes (2026-04-15 through 2026-04-19)
- Lab analyze >5MB photos: switched to URL-based Claude vision input
- Lab render >5MB photos: Runway + Kling prefer URL over base64
- Rating on any iteration: no longer gated on `isLatest`
- "Ready for approval" persists after rating: fixed — banner clears on feedback
- Director repeats prompts: new "DO NOT REPEAT" block with prior non-5★ prompts

### Design docs (2026-04-15)
- Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-spatial-grounding-design.md` — spatial grounding + unified embeddings (spatial half PAUSED)
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-unified-embeddings.md` — executed, complete
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-15-spatial-grounding.md` — PAUSED, annotated

## What shipped 2026-04-14 PM — reverse chronological

### Prompt Lab learning loop + async renders
- **Rendering state on list cards**: amber spinner over thumbnail, "Ready for approval" sky banner when clip exists but not rated, auto-refresh 15s when active.
- **Completed = any 5★ iteration OR recipe-promoted**. Was previously only recipe-promoted — dedup skips meant 5★ could stay "Ready for approval" indefinitely.
- **Latest iteration highlight**: 2px foreground border + pill; older iterations muted + opacity 0.8.
- **"Need to start" redefined**: means no admin feedback (rating/tag/comment/refinement), not "no iterations". Auto-analyzed-only sessions count as Need to start.
- **Per-batch filter chips**: All · Need to start · In progress · Completed with live counts.
- **Completed badge** on card thumbnails.
- **Drag-drop batches**: session cards draggable between batch headers; bottom drop-zone creates a new batch on drop; click batch title to rename all.
- **Multi-file upload + real file dropzone** on the new-session panel.
- **Batch label** field on sessions; grouped list view.
- **Auto-promote 5★ to recipe** with cosine-distance dedup (0.2 threshold).
- **Rating-weighted retrieval** — 5★ rank 15% closer than 4★ at same cosine distance.
- **Save rating** button (no forced refine).
- **Render persistence** — downloads provider CDN URL + re-uploads to Supabase Storage so clips survive CDN expiry + CORS.
- **Fire-and-forget render + cron finalizer** — render endpoint submits + returns; `/api/cron/poll-lab-renders` every minute downloads completed + sets clip_url. 30-min hard timeout.
- **Render UI**: provider picker (Auto/Kling/Runway), pending badge, render_error display, "open in new tab" link.
- **Rule-mining system** (M-L-4): DIRECTOR_PATCH_SYSTEM meta-prompt, mine endpoint, proposals page with diff + evidence buckets, apply → `lab_prompt_overrides` that Lab's director resolves at call time (prod untouched).
- **Recipe library** (M-L-3): table + promote button + UI at `/recipes`. Archetype matching in analyze.
- **Similarity retrieval** (M-L-2): pgvector + HNSW + `match_lab_iterations`/`match_lab_recipes` RPCs. "Based on N similar wins" / "Recipe · archetype" chips.
- **pgvector + embeddings** (M-L-1): enabled extension, added embedding columns, OpenAI wrapper, backfill script.

### Development dashboard
- New nav reorg: **Development** dropdown replaces separate Learning + Prompt Lab entries.
- New `/dashboard/development` landing page with **session notes** (working log, CRUD).
- `dev_session_notes` table, `/api/admin/dev-notes` endpoint.

### Prompt Lab core (earlier in the day)
- Initial M-Lab-1 through M-Lab-4 scaffolding: sessions + iterations tables, analyze + direct + refine + render endpoints, upload flow, iteration UI, rating widget, PromoteRecipeControl, Development page.

### Director prompt
- **M2B**: reveal hardening — foreground element must appear in photo's `key_features`, bans hallucinated reveals.

## Immediate next actions (start here next session)

0. **Back-on-track plan in flight (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-back-on-track-design.md`).** Phase A (Lab UX "next-action spine" redesign) is code-complete on branch `feature/back-on-track` — needs browser verification (run `npm run dev` in `.worktrees/back-on-track`, open any listing, check banner + chips + optimistic rate/archive). Phase M.1 verdict: **WORKING WITH GAPS** — learning loop is wired end-to-end (refutes "ML failed" hypothesis). Full audit at `docs/ML-AUDIT-2026-04-20.md`; raw traces at `docs/traces/`. Top fixes identified: back-fill prod scene embeddings (7/24 → 24/24), stop writing deprecated capture fields (`tags`, `refinement_instruction`), add UI nudge when Lab overrides become promotable.

1. **Validate shake fix on new renders** — the stability prefix + negative_prompt ship on every NEW Atlas render but won't improve existing iterations. Render one push-in or top-down and visually confirm reduced shake. If still shaky, lower cfg_scale (Atlas default ~0.5, try 0.3–0.4).
2. **Phase 3 prerequisites (autonomous iterator foundations)**:
   - **Prompt rewrite pass** — replace the raw "ADDITIONAL USER DIRECTIVES FROM PRIOR ITERATIONS:" concat in render.ts with a Sonnet call that rewrites director_prompt cleanly incorporating refinement_notes. Partially covered by the chat `update_director_prompt` tool but not automatic at render time.
   - **Expand v_rated_pool retrieval** — currently pooled for director input; autonomous iterator will also need it for scene-level decisioning ("which model did 5★ kitchens use?").
3. **Production base64→URL fix** — 4 places in `lib/pipeline.ts` still send base64. Lab is fixed; prod needs the same treatment.
4. **Use the listings Lab for data generation** — rate aggressively, archive junk, use Generate-all + Compare for A/B feedback. Recipe retrieval feeds back into every new listing's director.
5. **Route paired scenes to kling-v2-1-pair** — the SKU is purpose-built for start+end-frame rendering. Not yet auto-selected; user toggles it via "Generate all" for now.
6. **Spatial grounding** — designed (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-spatial-grounding-design.md`), PAUSED. Would give the director coordinate-level composition awareness.
7. **Shotstack reverse clips** — push_in/pull_out rhythm in assembled videos discussed but not built. Lab listings don't assemble to a final video yet.

## One-liner for next session

> Read `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` first. Prod pipeline is fire-and-forget + cron; all 6 stages unchanged. **Phase 2.8 (2026-04-20 evening)**: new listings-based Lab at `/dashboard/development/lab` on Atlas Cloud with 6 Kling SKUs (v3-pro default, Wan removed), multi-photo master-detail UI with ShotPlanTable + focused SceneCard, streaming scene chat via Haiku 4.5 with `save_future_instruction` + `update_director_prompt` tools, rating reasons taxonomy, scene + iteration archive, end-frame toggle (crop fallback dropped), shake fix (stability prefix + negative_prompt on every render), recipe + exemplar + loser retrieval restored in listings director, Generate-all-models + A/B/C Compare modal. Legacy Lab at `/dashboard/development/prompt-lab` still live. Next: validate shake on fresh renders, build prompt-rewrite pass for autonomous iterator, prod base64→URL fix.
