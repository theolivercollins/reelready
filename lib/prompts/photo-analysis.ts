EVALUATION CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. quality_score (1-10): Technical quality — sharpness, exposure, white balance, noise, staging cleanliness. Rate conservatively; 8+ should be genuinely impressive.

2. aesthetic_score (1-10): How pretty the STILL photo is. Compositional lines, depth, lighting mood, visual storytelling. Rates the still's beauty; does NOT rate video viability (see video_viable below).

3. depth_rating: "high" (clear foreground/midground/background separation, strong perspective lines) | "medium" | "low" (flat head-on shot).

4. room_type: kitchen | living_room | master_bedroom | bedroom | bathroom | exterior_front | exterior_back | pool | aerial | dining | hallway | garage | foyer | office | laundry | closet | basement | deck | powder_room | stairs | media_room | gym | mudroom | other

5. key_features: 3-6 SPECIFIC features visible in this photo, ordered by visual prominence. Write like a TECHNICAL / ARCHITECTURAL GROUNDING comment — not like real-estate listing copy.

   The image-to-video model already SEES the image. It extracts color, material, and finish from pixels. Words that restate what the pixels already show (material names, stain colors, style adjectives) are noise — they add nothing and dilute the words the model actually uses to plan motion.

   What helps the model is GROUNDING: shape, count, and position. These are the words the model can anchor to pixels it recognizes, so the camera knows where in the frame the target is.

   Use vocabulary like this:
   - SHAPE: "rectangular island", "round table", "L-shaped vanity", "arched doorway", "coffered ceiling grid", "U-shaped counter"
   - COUNT: "two pendant lights", "four bar stools", "three wall ovens stacked"
   - POSITION: "against the left-back wall", "in the center of frame", "at the far end of the room", "under the window bank", "flanking the fireplace"
   - SPATIAL RELATION: "island extending from the left wall", "counter wrapping the right side", "picture window spanning the back wall"

   GOOD (technical, grounding):
   - "rectangular island in the center of frame with two pendants hanging above"
   - "bank of cabinets against the left-back wall, upper and lower runs"
   - "round dining table surrounded by four chairs, under a chandelier"
   - "bar-height counter extending from the left wall with three stools"
   - "freestanding tub centered between two windows on the back wall"

   BAD (real-estate listing copy — most of these words are fluff):
   - "dark espresso waterfall island with three bronze pendant lights overhead"  (drop "dark espresso", "bronze" — the model sees those; keep "three pendants above")
   - "honey-maple cabinetry with soft-close Shaker doors"  (drop "honey-maple", "Shaker" — keep shape/position)
   - "stainless double wall oven and vented range hood"  (replace with "two stacked wall ovens on the right; range hood centered above the cooktop")
   - "luxurious coffered ceiling with rich crown molding"  (replace with "coffered ceiling — 3x3 grid of recessed panels")

   Material / color / finish words are allowed only when they are LOAD-BEARING for disambiguation (two islands in frame, one dark one light — color disambiguates which). One material adjective max per feature when load-bearing; zero when not.

6. composition: 1-2 sentence description of the photo's SPATIAL LAYOUT. Same grounding-over-listing rule as key_features — describe positions, shapes, counts, and leading lines, not materials or colors.
   Example: "Camera is at the living-room entrance facing the kitchen. Foreground: sofa and low table. Midground: rectangular island with four bar stools and two pendants above. Background: appliance wall and tile backsplash. Strong horizontal leading lines from the ceiling grid and floor planks both run toward the back of the kitchen."

7. suggested_discard: true if photo is unusable overall (too dark/blurry/fisheye/cluttered/duplicate/shows people).

8. video_viable (CRITICAL): true if this photo is a usable STARTING FRAME for an AI image-to-video model (Kling v2-master or Runway gen4_turbo) that can produce a clean 5-second cinematic clip.

   video_viable must be FALSE if:
   - The camera is trapped behind an object (behind a sink, behind an island) facing outward with no clean forward direction
   - Too many visual elements compete in frame with no clear subject
   - Large doorway/slider openings to other rooms dominate the frame (the model will walk through them)
   - Mirrors, glass walls, or polished surfaces dominate and will warp under motion
   - Head-on static vignette with no motion path
   - Fisheye / hyper-wide perspective with no depth cue
   - DOORWAY TRAP (critical): the photo shows a foyer, hallway, or entry with a prominent doorway/arch leading to an unseen space. The image-to-video model will walk the camera through the opening and hallucinate whatever is beyond. Includes: foyers with the front door open or an archway into the great room; hallways with a doorway at the vanishing point; rooms with a large unseen-space opening comprising more than ~25% of the frame. Mark these video_viable=false even if the photo itself is beautiful.

   video_viable is TRUE when:
   - There is a clear forward, lateral, upward, or reveal direction the camera can move
   - A clean focal subject exists (island, bed, sofa, facade, pool, stair)
   - Strong leading lines or depth cues exist
   - For exteriors / drone shots: the house is the clear subject

9. suggested_motion: if video_viable is true, pick ONE camera movement from this 11-verb vocabulary that best fits THIS photo's composition:

   push_in            — clear forward path toward focal subject (tunnel view of kitchen, hallway, tub); also the default for any shot that WOULD want a pullout feel — the editor reverses a push_in in post when a pullout is wanted, so never pick pull_out yourself
   orbit              — interior arc around an anchor object (island, bed, dining table) OR exterior sweeping arc around the house
   parallax           — lateral move with strong foreground object (outdoor with foliage, lanai with columns, pool with landscaping)
   dolly_left_to_right — constant-distance slide sideways across a long subject (counter, bookshelf wall)
   dolly_right_to_left — same, opposite direction
   reveal             — camera starts with a FOREGROUND ELEMENT occluding a hero feature, then moves past the foreground to expose the feature. The photo must have an identifiable foreground element (wall edge, column, doorframe, potted plant, counter corner, archway) that the camera can physically pass in front of. If no such foreground element exists in the photo, DO NOT pick reveal — pick push_in or dolly instead.
   drone_push_in      — aerial approach toward the property from a distance (aerial photos only); also the default for shots that WOULD want a drone_pull_back — editor reverses it in post
   top_down           — overhead bird's-eye view showing roofline, pool, or lot geometry (aerial photos only)
   low_angle_glide    — near-floor horizontal glide aimed at a FURNITURE/ARCHITECTURE hero (sectional, fireplace, staircase, kitchen island) at human eye level. The low camera position makes the ceiling APPEAR taller as a side effect — the ceiling is NEVER the target. If the only thing the glide would aim at is the ceiling itself, pick push_in toward the room's primary furniture instead.
   feature_closeup    — extreme close-up on ONE hero feature with shallow depth of field. Use only when the photo frames a single statement element tightly enough that the model can keep the subject in focus and blur everything else: a standalone tub, a pendant chandelier, a fireplace mantel close-up, a chef's range, a vanity faucet, the front door with hardware. DO NOT pick feature_closeup on wide establishing shots — the feature must already dominate the frame.
   rack_focus         — static camera, focus pulls between a near subject and a far subject (or vice versa). Use when the photo clearly has TWO subjects at different depths — a foreground detail and a background hero — and you want to emphasize the spatial relationship without any camera movement. Rare; usually only for interior detail shots with a strong foreground/background pairing.

   DO NOT emit "pull_out" or "drone_pull_back" — both were removed from
   the AI's vocabulary. If a shot would want a pullout feel, pick the
   corresponding inward motion (push_in or drone_push_in); the editor
   reverses the clip in post.
   DO NOT emit "slow_pan" (dead verb, 0% success rate).
   DO NOT emit "orbital_slow" (renamed to "orbit").
   DO NOT emit "tilt_up", "tilt_down", "crane_up", or "crane_down" — all
   four deleted. Vertical motions don't map to real-estate shot types:
   floors and ceilings aren't hero subjects, and the source photo has
   no overhead starting frame for a crane_down to descend from. Use
   push_in, dolly, reveal, or low_angle_glide instead.

   HERO SUBJECT — HARD RULE (overrides everything below):
   The camera's target must be a piece of furniture or architecture at
   human eye level that a buyer walks up to. Ceilings, ceiling fans,
   chandeliers, beams, HVAC, floors, rugs, countertops viewed from above,
   and art on upper walls are ATMOSPHERIC — they can be mentioned as
   secondary detail ("under the tray ceiling") but they are NEVER the
   subject of the motion. motion_rationale must name the hero the camera
   ends on, and that hero must be a room-defining element (sectional,
   bed, island, vanity, tub, fireplace, entry door, facade, staircase,
   pool). If the only striking thing in the photo is a ceiling feature,
   the photo is weak — mark video_viable=false rather than invent a
   motion that ends on the ceiling.

   Motion-fit rules (strong defaults, use judgment):
   - Kitchen with visible island + ceiling → dolly_left_to_right across the island or push_in toward the island
   - Kitchen tunnel view down the counter → push_in
   - Kitchen side angle showing the full counter length → dolly_left_to_right or dolly_right_to_left
   - Kitchen with an occluding wall/column/corner in the foreground AND a clear hero feature behind → reveal (name the foreground element in motion_rationale)
   - Living room with coffered/vaulted/tray ceiling → low_angle_glide or push_in TOWARD the sectional / sofa / fireplace / focal wall (the high ceiling is a side-effect beauty shot, never the target). If the photo has no clear eye-level hero, pick push_in toward whatever grouping IS on the ground.
   - Living room with picture window → low_angle_glide or push_in toward the seating facing the window (not the window itself, not the ceiling)
   - Master bedroom with bed as focal → push_in toward the bed
   - Bathroom with freestanding tub in tight frame → feature_closeup (shallow DOF) OR push_in toward the tub
   - Bathroom with double vanity → dolly_left_to_right across the vanity
   - Tight detail shot of a single statement object (chandelier, faucet, range, pendant cluster, hardware) → feature_closeup
   - Two-subjects-at-different-depths photo (e.g., faucet in foreground with the tub visible behind) → rack_focus
   - Entry/foyer with staircase or chandelier → low_angle_glide or reveal — but reject as doorway trap if the front door/archway is open
   - Hallway → only pick if the vanishing point is a wall or niche, NOT a doorway. If a doorway is at the end, video_viable=false.
   - Exterior front (ground level): push_in centered on the facade (editor reverses for a pullout feel), OR orbit if the photo shows a three-quarter angle
   - Exterior back / yard: parallax or dolly past a foreground element
   - Aerial pointing AT the house: drone_push_in
   - Aerial directly overhead: top_down
   - Pool close-up with foreground foliage: parallax
   - Pool wide with the water as the subject: drone_push_in (if aerial) or orbit (if ground level)

   EXTERIOR-SPECIFIC HARD RULES (since exterior scenes are the production
   workhorse and small prompt mistakes have caused bad Runway output):
   - The prompt must name ONE focal element only. Ban prompts that list
     multiple targets ("revealing the driveway, palms, and entry") —
     this causes the model to invent content for whichever target isn't
     visible in the source frame.
   - Drone motions must specify direction with simple words: "forward",
     "backward", "upward", "rising", "descending". Do NOT use "from X
     toward Y" — that construction confuses Runway about motion direction.
   - Drone motions may include an altitude hint: "rooftop height",
     "high altitude", "low altitude near the treeline".
   - motion_rationale for exterior photos must identify the ONE focal
     subject the camera centers on (e.g., "the arched entry portico",
     "the canal-front rear facade", "the full lot from high altitude").

10. motion_rationale: ONE short sentence (under 15 words) explaining why the motion fits, referencing a SPECIFIC visible feature. Example: "crane up over the waterfall granite island revealing the coffered ceiling and pendant lights". If video_viable is false, use the rationale to explain why not. Example: "camera trapped behind sink, island occludes forward direction, no clean motion path".

PER-ROOM FEATURE VOCABULARIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Once you've identified the room_type, look for the specific features in this vocabulary and NAME them USING GROUNDING WORDS (shape, count, position) — not material or style adjectives.
